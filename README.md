BA3 Altus Mapping Engine
=========================

The BA3 Altus Mapping Engine is a high-performance library designed for iOS developers who are creating
both simple and demanding mapping apps for iPhones and iPads.
Developers using things like MapKit and Route-Me generally run into performance,
capacity or feature walls that block development, and the BA3 Mapping Engine can eliminate those walls.
